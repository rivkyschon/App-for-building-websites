## web design 

web design  is a small website builder. It aims to be an alternative to the increasingly complex static site generators and content managers available today.

With web design you would just write your posts in markdown using the built-in online editor. 

It can be used for personal websites, blogs, quick prototypes or as a baseline for more complex sites.

A node.js server is used to provide some dynamic content like comments, image upload and markdown editing.

### Features
1. All content statically generated
2. Admin panel with authentication
3. Online markdown editor
4. Image upload
5. Default theme
6. Simple comments system with email notifications

The project includes a server side and a client side and a MySQL database
